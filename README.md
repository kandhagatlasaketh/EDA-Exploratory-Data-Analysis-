Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand, clean, and analyze a dataset before applying machine learning models. EDA helps uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test assumptions, and gain meaningful insights from data using statistical and visual techniques.

*Objectives
Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset
Handle missing values and outliers
Perform statistical analysis
Visualize relationships between variables
Generate insights to support decision-making

* Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook

* Dataset Description
Dataset contains structured data with numerical and categorical features
Includes information relevant to analysis and prediction
Source: (Mention source if available, e.g., Kaggle / CSV file)

 Steps Performed in EDA
 
1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection
Loaded dataset using Pandas
Checked data types, shape, and column names

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handled missing values
Removed or treated duplicates
Corrected inconsistent data

3️⃣ Statistical Analysis
Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
Distribution analysis

4️⃣ Data Visualization
Univariate analysis (histograms, box plots)
Bivariate analysis (scatter plots, correlation heatmaps)
Multivariate analysis where required

5️⃣ Insights & Observations
Identified key trends and patterns
Detected outliers and anomalies
Understood feature relationships

* Key Insights

Certain features show strong correlation with the target variable
Presence of outliers that impact data distribution
Data imbalance observed in categorical variables
(Customize this section based on your dataset)

* Conclusion

This EDA process provided a deep understanding of the dataset and prepared it for further machine learning modeling. The insights gained can help in feature selection, model building, and improving overall prediction performance.
